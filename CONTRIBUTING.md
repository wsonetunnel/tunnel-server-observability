# Contributing to Tunnel Server Observability
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added/modified code, ensure that the changes deploy successfully.
3. Update the documentation as necessary.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue the pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/wsonetunnel/tunnel-server-observability/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/wsonetunnel/tunnel-server-observability/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* For yml changes, follow yaml format, example [here](https://dev.to/kalkwst/a-gentle-introduction-to-the-yaml-format-bi6)

## License
